I am an incoming postdoctoral researcher in machine learning at the [University of Oxford](https://eng.ox.ac.uk/) with the [Torr Vision Group](https://torrvision.com/). My work focuses on the intersection of artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and agentic frameworks.


**I think it is important to spend your time on things that genuinely excite you**. During my Master's in Statistics at [UCT](https://www.uct.ac.za/), I was passionate about biomedical modelling and deep learning. My PhD at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/) and [Idiap](https://www.idiap.ch/) it was theoretical machine learning and NLP. I explored the foundations of attention and its connections to Bayesian nonparametric statistics. Along the way, I have interned at Amazon on code generation and explored music generation projects. With the growing influence of AI, I believe researchers have a responsibility to work on problems that are socially grounded. This is why I am joining the Torr Vision Group at Oxford for a postdoc focused on AI for legal modelling!


**Personality** I believe in leadership by example, and I see honesty, humility, and kindness as the ultimate optimisations: free to give, invaluable to receive. I am passionate and tenacious in my work, but try to always keep a sense of humour. I am happiest when I have a balance of rigorous mental stimulation, relaxed social interaction, and regular outdoor exercise.
